Chris is the [Director of Modeling and Simulation at Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com/), the 
[Director of Scientific Research at Pumas-AI](https://pumas.ai/), [Co-PI of the Julia Lab at MIT](https://julia.mit.edu/), and 
the [lead developer of the SciML Open Source Software Organization](https://sciml.ai/). He is the lead developer of the Pumas 
project and has received a top presentation award at every ACoP in the last 3 years for improving methods for uncertainty 
quantification, automated GPU acceleration of nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NLME), and machine learning assisted 
construction of NLME models with DeepNLME. For these achievements, Chris received the Emerging Scientist award from ISoP. 
For his work in mechanistic machine learning, his work is credited for the 15,000x acceleration of NASA Launch Services 
simulations and recently demonstrated a 60x-570x acceleration over Modelica tools in HVAC simulation, earning Chris the US 
Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator Scientific Excellence Award.
